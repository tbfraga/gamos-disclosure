*** Work in progress:

-->> Development of local search heuristics based algorithms to solve the production planning problem (p-batch s-batch) in a plastic bag production factory.

    *** I am thinking of using the particle collision heuristic, which was adapted by me, to solve discrete problems, from the particle collision method, developed by Prof. Wagner Sacco.
    *** Other heuristics or new ideas may be developed, tested and applied.

-->> Creation of a compound algorithm to predict product demand with different demand patterns.

    *** When I created the demand forecast project in November 2020, I was reading scientific articles and I had the idea of working with compound methods, using standard forecasting method for normal data and working with other methods (such as neural networks) to treat the change in the forecast around the leftover. I thought of this technique and left the idea aside because I was busy with other things. At the moment I am thinking of a new idea of using the data partition. But for now it's just an idea. Soon I will be working with the development of a demand forecasting method. I hope it works.

-->> Elaboration of a scientific article for publication of the particle collision applied to discrete problem solving (part of my doctoral work).

-->> Elaboration of scientific article for the publication of the undergraduate work of my guiding Edwedja. 
    
    *** In this work the student modeled the chain stock problem and created an optimization algorithm for the problem based on the simulated annealing method.

-->> COPSolver: continue software development along with works development.
    
    *** COPSolver is currently gaining new libraries for Multicriteria ABC classification (with Saat's Analytical Hierarchy Process method) and identification of demand patterns with the Willians demand partition method.

-->> I will be focusing on the completion (if possible) and the publication of all work ongoing, more than on the development of new works.
    
    *** But I have a huge difficulty not to get involved with new projects. I'll try.
