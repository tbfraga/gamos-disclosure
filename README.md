*** Work ongoing:

-->> Development of local search heuristics based algorithms to solve the production planning problem (p-batch s-batch) in a plastic bag production factory.


-->> Creation of a compound algorithm to predict product demand with different demand patterns.

    *** When I created the demand forecast project in November 2020, I was reading scientific articles and I had the idea of working with compound methods, using standard forecasting method for normal data and working with other methods (such as neural networks) to treat the change in the forecast around the leftover. I thought of this technique and left the idea aside because I was busy with other things. At the moment I am thinking of a new idea of using the data partition. But for now it's just an idea. Soon I will be working with the development of a demand forecasting method. I hope it works.
